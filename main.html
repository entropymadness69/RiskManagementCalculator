<!-- Future plans: 

    'Kinda crue but works!' 

    Build in React or Vuejs + tailwindcss for frontend and make app accessible to experienced and new users. i.e (Explain what each field is and why it is important in a user-friendly way (have user hover over the labels and it will show them what these things mean))
    Make mobile friendly as well. 

    What each field is: 
        Single Loss Expectancy (SLE) is the loss incurred due to the realisation of a threat represented as a monetary value. 
        Loss Value is pretty much the same as the ALE but already pre-calculated before the safeguard. 
        Asset Value is the monetary valuation of an asset.
        Exposure Factor (EF) is the percentage of loss a realised threat can cause to an asset. usually 2 different values before and after the safeguard. 
        Annualised Rate of Occurrence (ARO) is the expected number of times this threat is realised yearly, i.e., frequency per year.
        Annualised Loss Expectancy (ALE) is the loss the company expects to lose per year due to the threat. This helps us decide whether paying for a particular control or safeguard is justified. This is also known as the "loss value" before the safeguard.
        Annual cost is the cost of the safeguard per year. So if it is say $10 a month, multiply that by 12 to get $120. $120 would be the annual cost of the safeguard. 

    Backend maybe django or nodejs for server-side
    Build unit tests to help make sure everything works!
    Put in Github and likely make open-source

    <h1>Hello Security Engineer! </h1>
    
    <p> Below is a Risk Management Calculator. This is used to determine the value of the safeguards that you need or not need to apply a control for your company. If the result becomes a negative after this calculation, please do not use this safeguard and look for other options.</p>
